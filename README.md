# WOWLA
## World of Warcraft: Lua API
----
### What is WOWLA?
WOWLA is (at the moment) a personal project to bring together and update as needed any available documentation on the LUA Api for World of Warcraft.

### Aren't there other sites with documentation available already?
Many of the old documentation sites for WoWs Lua have been lost to time or abandoned. Currently, various wikis have most of the API documented -  but a great many of the articles are out of date or missing documention (partially or entirely). 
It is hoped that by starting a dedicated project for documentation - it can help to improve the accuracy of the documentation as well as improve the experience of others who want to make use of this documentation.

### Why start a new source of documentation?
By hosting this via GitHub, the intention is that anyone can make use of it, participate in it's development and maintenance, or take it in an entirely different direction by cloning this repository.

## Goals
* Produce a documentation site that is easy to navigate and responsive
* Bring together known documentation
* Update known documentation as needed, or add documentation where missing if possible.
* Make it easy for others to contribute to the project (as normally done with open-source projects on GitHub.  i.e. pull requests, issues etc.)
* Present examples and links to helpful ressources to help users who are new to making addons, using LUA, or writing code in general.
